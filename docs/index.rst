Overview
============================
**pyRuleAnalyzer** is a Python-based tool designed to support rule extraction, analysis, and simplification from tree-based artificial intelligence models. It provides a comprehensive pipeline to generate interpretable models, remove redundancies, and evaluate model accuracy and interpretability.

Key functionalities include:

* Extracting decision rules from tree-based models.
* Identifying and removing redundant and duplicate rules.
* Evaluating initial and simplified models through classification accuracy, confusion matrices, and interpretability metrics.
* Computing sparsity and interpretability scores to assess model complexity and understandability.
* Saving, loading, and applying rule-based classifiers on new datasets.
